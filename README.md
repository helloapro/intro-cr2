## README introCodeReview2
_The purpose of this is to showcase what I've learned with JavaScript. I'm able to make forms in HTML and call upon functions in jQuery that interact with user inputs. This particular form asks my user to answer a few multiple choice questions in order to determine what city they should visit next. I have five questions as well as five different cities they might get from the survey._

## Project Title & Description
_introCodeReview2 [Second Intro to Programming (Evening) code review]_

 ## Setup/Installation Requirements
- _First you create a directory_
- _Create folders within the directory to house your styling, images, and javascript_
- _Download bootstrap.css and the latest uncompressed jquery files from the internet_
- _Create styles.css and scripts.js files_
- _Outline five questions with five answers to choose each for five potential city outcomes. I chose to do this on paper_
- _Create js functionality based on outline. The logic was played with a few times based on my own thought process and preference. The math is tricky here. I utilized branching as well as && and || operators._
- _Add content to your landing page to reflect the intent, classes, and IDs established in your js_
- _Stylize the content to your individual preference using tools learned through class. The most important and basic styling was to hide the result of city from the survey initially until after the Submit button is hit._
- _Make sure you reference all your project links and images appropriately_
- _Commit your changes regularly_

## Known Bugs
_More stylization can be made. Most focus was put on functionality. Haven't tested the survey enough to see if outcomes are the most optimal or make the most sense._

_Can't get images to toggle how I'd like by removing one picture in favor of the other if the user wants to input new answers without refreshing the page._
